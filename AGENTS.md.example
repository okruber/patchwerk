# Agent Configuration Template

Copy this to your project's AGENTS.md and customize the marked sections.

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: [Describe what this project does, who uses it, what problem it solves]

**Tech Stack**:
- Language: [Python, TypeScript, etc.]
- Package Management: [uv, npm, cargo, etc.]
- Testing: [pytest, jest, cargo test, etc.]
- Infrastructure: [GCP, AWS, Azure, on-prem, etc.]
- VCS: [Git workflow preferences]

**Architecture**: [Brief description - microservices, monolith, skills-based routing, etc.]

---

## CRITICAL: Before Writing Any Code

**CRITICAL: [Package management rule, e.g., "Prefer `uv` for package management"]**

**CRITICAL: NEVER push code to remote (git push) unless the user explicitly requests it.**

**CRITICAL: [Add other project-specific critical warnings]**
<!-- Examples:
- NEVER run terraform apply/destroy unless explicitly asked
- NEVER modify production database directly
- NEVER run docker compose down -v (destroys volumes)
-->

**Load these skills FIRST:**

- **[Context]** → `[skill-name]` ([what it provides])

<!-- Examples:
- **Python code** → `dignified-python` skill (LBYL, modern types, ABC interfaces)
- **Test code** → `fake-driven-testing` skill (5-layer architecture, test placement)
- **Debugging** → `debugging-framework` skill (4-phase systematic approach)
- **GCP operations** → `gcp-observability` skill (token-efficient workflows)
-->

## Core Principles

- **Greenfield by default**: Get explicit approval before implementing backward compatibility
- **YAGNI/DRY/SOLID**: Best code is no code - only build what's needed now
- **Progressive disclosure**: Load skills for detailed guidance
- **Simplicity over cleverness**: Readability and maintainability are primary concerns
- **Ask, don't assume**: Clarify requirements rather than guessing
- **Never discard on failure**: Modify existing code instead of rewriting

**For detailed [domain] standards** → load `[skill-name]` skill

<!-- Examples:
**For Python-specific standards** → load `dignified-python` skill
**For testing guidance** → load `fake-driven-testing` skill
-->

---

## Tool Routing

### [Tool Category] → Use `[agent-name]` agent

Commands: [command1, command2, etc.]

**FORBIDDEN prompts:**
- [Prompts that misuse the agent]

**REQUIRED pattern:**
- [Correct usage patterns]

<!-- Example:
### Development Commands → Use `devrun` agent

Commands: pytest, ty, ruff, prettier, make

**FORBIDDEN prompts:**
- "fix any errors that arise"
- "make the tests pass"

**REQUIRED pattern:**
- "Run [command] and report results"

devrun is READ-ONLY. It runs commands and reports. Parent agent handles all fixes.

## Skill Loading Behavior

Skills persist for the entire session. Once loaded, they remain in context.

- DO NOT reload skills already loaded in this session
- Hook reminders fire as safety nets, not commands
- Check if loaded: Look for `<command-message>The "{name}" skill is loading</command-message>` earlier in conversation

---

## Quick Reference

**Naming**:
- Claude artifacts (`.claude/`): `kebab-case` (NOT underscores)
- Never name things 'improved', 'new', 'enhanced' - code naming should be evergreen
- [Add language-specific conventions if non-standard]

**Package management**: [tool preference]

**Version control**: [workflow rules]

<!-- Add high-frequency patterns you type repeatedly -->

---

## Project Constraints

**No time estimates in plans:**
- FORBIDDEN: Time estimates (hours, days, weeks)
- FORBIDDEN: Velocity predictions or completion dates

**Test discipline:**
- FORBIDDEN: Writing tests for speculative features
- ALLOWED: TDD workflow (write test → implement → refactor)
- MUST: Only test actively implemented code

<!-- Add project-specific constraints:
- **Documentation**: NEVER update CHANGELOG.md (handled by release process)
- **Dependencies**: NEVER upgrade major versions without approval
-->
